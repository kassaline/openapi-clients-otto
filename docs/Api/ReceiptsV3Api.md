### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer (JWT) authorization: bearerAuth
$config = OpenAPI\Client\Otto\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Otto\Api\ReceiptsV3Api(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$limit = 128; // int | Page size to limit the number of receipts returned in the response
$page = 1; // int | Page number to fetch. This parameter is required to fetch data for specific page number. </br>This field is deprecated, please use 'next' parameter
$receiptTypes = PURCHASE,REFUND; // string[] | Search for receipts filtered by multiple receipt types.  </br>PURCHASE - A purchase receipt (also known as an invoice) records the prices charged to the customer at the time of sale. The receipt contains information per order, partner and shipment. It is generated when items are shipped to the customer, so there may be more than one receipt per order. Shipping costs are charged only once per partner and per order, and are billed with first purchase receipt of this partner order. Surcharges imposed by payment provider on the customer for using special payment conditions are not included in the OTTO Market receipts.  </br>REFUND - We distinguish between different types of reimbursement documents. A refund receipt documents a credit note issued to a customer for a refund. This document is currently created when returns are accepted.  In very rare cases, refund receipts may also be created during the cancellation process to reimburse shipping costs for full returns.  Previous partial refunds will be taken into account.  </br> PARTIAL_REFUND -  We distinguish different types of reimbursement documents. A partial refund receipt documents a credit note issued to a customer without return.  As a partner, you might offer a customer a partial refund if there is a legitimate complaint to avoid a return.  </br>If no receiptType is provided, receipts  of all existing receiptTypes will be returned.  <b>Please for your own interest, hand over all receipt types you are interested in using the list parameter receiptTypes, so that OTTO Market could add new receipt types without side effects for your own processes. Using this option you can decide by your own when to incorporate new receipt types in your own processes.   Please do not use the possibility of calls without specifying the receiptTypes anymore.</b>
