The aim is to help you as a partner of OTTO Market to connect to and to work with the OTTO Market API. It describes some common implementation patterns and helps you to understand how processes work. Detailed information about the concrete interfaces can be accessed by clicking onto the single tabs.  ## Authorization (OAuth2)  ### Fetching an Access Token To access the Otto Market API, you need to authenticate your API user account and obtain an access token. This section describes how to obtain an access token using the password grant type.  #### Requesting an Access Token To request an access token, send a POST request to the /token endpoint of the Otto Market API with the following parameters:  * <b>username</b>: Your API user account username. * <b>password</b>: Your API user account password. Make sure to URL-encode any special characters. * <b>grant_type</b>: Set to \"password\" to indicate that you're using the password grant type to obtain an access token. * <b>client_id</b>: Identifies your application to the API. Set to \"token-otto-api\".  For example, you can use the following cURL command to retrieve your access token:  ``` curl -X POST \\ https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\ -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\ -d 'username=<YourUsername>&password=<YourPassword>&grant_type=password&client_id=token-otto-api' ```  Note that you need to include your own username and password in the cURL command and URL-encode any special characters. For example, if your password is \"my!@password\", you would include it in the command above as \"my%21%40password\".  Alternatively, you can let cURL encode the POST data by using --data-urlencode instead:  ``` curl -X POST \\   https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\   --data-urlencode username=<YourUsername> \\   --data-urlencode password=<YourPassword> \\   --data-urlencode grant_type=password \\   --data-urlencode client_id=token-otto-api  ``` #### Response  If your request is successful, the API server responds with an access token in a JSON object that looks like this:  ``` {   \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiISNCXIgiLCJSZWNla[...omitted for brevity...]\",   \"expires_in\": 1800,   \"refresh_expires_in\": 7200,   \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOO[...omitted for brevity...]\",   \"token_type\": \"bearer\",   \"not-before-policy\": 0,   \"session_state\": \"3e0710b2-b57a-4cb0-a51d-6de60a997356\",   \"scope\": \"pumba-roles-app-portal partner email profile\" } ```  The <b>\"access_token\"</b> property contains the access token that you can use to authenticate subsequent requests to the Otto Market API. Make sure to include the access token in the Authorization header of your API requests, using the Bearer token type.   ### Example Here's an example cURL command that retrieves a list of products from the Otto Market API, using the access token obtained in the previous step: ``` curl -X GET \\ https://api.otto.market/v2/products \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' \\ -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' ``` This cURL command sends a GET request to the /v2/products endpoint of the Otto Market API, with the Authorization header set to the access token obtained in the previous step. The -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' option is included to ensure that the server doesn't return a cached response.  #### Best-practice when renewing a token  Use available tokens as long as possible before fetching a new `access_token`. In general new access_tokens should be fetched by using the `refresh_token`. Expiration date of an access token is indicated by the attribute `expires_in` for access_tokens and `refresh_expires_in` for refresh_tokens. Please bear in mind that a refresh token can only be used once. In other words, once a refresh token is used to obtain a new access token, then the same refresh token cannot be reused even if it has not yet expired.   ### Use refresh token A single refresh token can only be used to obtain a new access token, if  1) The refresh token has not expired, and 2) The refresh token has not been used before.  The refresh token can be extracted from the <code class=\"inline\">refresh_token</code> value. Once the access token has expired or is going to be expired, you should use the refresh token to get a new access token, without using your users credentials again. You can use the following cURL command. Include the refresh token (without leading and trailing < >). ``` curl -X POST \\   https://api.otto.market/v1/token \\   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\   -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\   -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>&grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=token-otto-api' ```  The response of this request will look like the example above, the access token can be extracted from <code class=\"inline\">access_token</code> and the new refresh token from <code class=\"inline\">refresh_token</code>.  ## API Access for Partner cooperating with a Service Provider `Note:` *This feature is not available for all partners. If you want access, create a support ticket for the category [Technische Schnittstellen](https://portal.otto.market)*  If you are cooperating with a Service Provider you will get a link for installing an app of this Service Provider. In order to do so follow the steps below: 1. Login to [OTTO Partner Connect (OPC)](https://portal.otto.market) portal. 2. Click on the link you got from the Service Provider (either directly or from e.g. the homepage of this Service Provider). 3. You will be asked to grant consent that the app is allowed to access the scopes displayed in the consent screen (e.g., products or orders).    If you don't grant consent nothing will happen. The app won't be installed and thus won't be able to access your data.    `Note:` *In order to install the app you have to grant access to all the specified scopes. Allowing only a part of them is not possible.* 4. If you grant consent the app is \"installed\" and you can use it. It is now also displayed in the installed apps tab (\"Installierte Apps\") on the [service provider page (\"Dienstleister\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Dienstleister)  ### Revoke Consent  If you want to revoke your consent you can do so by navigating to the overview of your installed apps (\"Installierte Apps\") on the [service provider page (\"Dienstleister\")](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Dienstleister). Hover over the app name to get the Button for revoking consent (\"Zugriff entziehen\"). When clicking on this button you get a popup window asking you to confirm that you want to revoke your consent. If you do so, the app gets uninstalled meaning it has no longer access to your data and you cannot use it any longer. Of course, you can re-install the app if you want to.  ## API Access for Service Providers Refer [Developer Program](/docs#section/Developer-Program) section below for more details about authentication and authorization. Once you have authentication and authorization, read further for the next steps.  ## Calling an Endpoint All endpoints are secured via authorization. You add the HTTP <code class=\"inline\">Authorization</code> -Header with value <code class=\"inline\">Bearer ey...</code> and will get access. ``` curl -X GET \\   https://api.otto.market/v2/orders \\   -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5jdhstdheSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICI4T1d6MjhuZ01GbHBURDl5TGtxQkRHMThuYXZNVFgyTWtqNVhkY0RITDBZIn0.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.SleUexNdapaY5RmrVTbKRMiVpRrbNLjIUi7fILsW1hkpqQbX4IQRaSufSt98Ar0OkEmIvZvYPpGVecmjwYvD3YQzBmlcdU0V544Y0h8y01RyxZAYGZbRXfA1kOsFDucnrClCcj1JIaQMU4629wU9OM_SdQaLvfTA2l5prma94RekdWR3S-6DzXqJDtHrrcYS8BsfohkuLdi1U8vPUjwee9lsY3RTa9YZVekH4hFVWMl0Pbwub8jwum6zRjTu-ZAiLhZSnl8mSaMtrJFmkzRi3-s9eN7k0lnLKWGt7JuqZ_vbiJT8ZhHvPur4eLrY02ehF6-lwSUyjWMCzCi5TjBgYg' ```  The expected result has an HTTP 200 code with a probably empty list.  ## Rate Limiting A high volume of calls on API services at any given time would increase server resource consumption. If the load is due to an unauthorized intrusion it would be a chaos. Thus, rate limiting becomes extremely important.  In general authenticated API calls are limited for each partner to 20 requests per second. Exceeding the rate limit results in a HTTP 429 \"too many requests\" error. For some endpoints the rate limit is lower to ensure the best quality for all API users. Please see below:  |Endpoint path|HTTP method|Max requests per time unit| |:-|:-|:-| |/products|GET|10 per second| |/products|POST|20 per second| |/products/active-status|GET|10 per second| |/products/active-status|POST|3600 per day| |/products/marketplace-status|GET|10 per second| |/products/categories|GET|10 per second| |/products/brands|GET|10 per second| |/v1/token|POST|10 per second for each IP| |other endpoints|POST & GET|20 per second|  ### User Based API Throttling A general method of limiting usage of API resource is to allocate a pre-configured static or dynamic quota for a consumer. The API rate limiting is done on the basis of partner-id. A particular partner-id can make 20 requests per second.  ### Best Practice Please divide your requests over the day and avoid sending all data at once. Make use of the individual limits for the interfaces. This helps preventing our systems from clogging and ensures a flawless experience for everyone.  ## Timeouts and Defaults | Name            | Value | Description                                                                                                     | |-----------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | request timeout | 10s   | The maximum HTTP request timeout for all interfaces                                                             | | limit           | 128   | The default for limit query parameter. See Paging. The default limit can be overwritten in specific interfaces. |  ## Common Patterns ### Interface Definition Our REST interface definitions are basically using swagger.io. All interface definitions can be automatically used by you to generate necessary API objects and similar in your chosen implementation language. In order to remain technically extensible and up-to-date, individual interfaces may have been described in new or different definition schemes. We are constantly trying to keep all interfaces technically up to date.  ### Versioning The OTTO Market API uses different versions for the single endpoints. The version number is included in the URL path. [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme is used, but only the major version. Breaking changes are only introduced in new major versions. API version is required in all urls.  Endpoints may introduce new optional fields at any time in the request and any new fields in the response. The client must skip all unknown fields.  For every endpoint, a changelog exists which displays the latest released changes and the upcoming unreleased changes. Additionally, an overall [Changelog](/) exists with the most exciting changes about the API in general.  ### Supporting old versions The OTTO Partner API continues to support old versions of an API for **6 months** from the time of public announcement for the new version of a given API. It is recommanded to check regularly. This can be be automated by checking HTTP headers for the attribute `SunsetHeader`, which indicates when versions go offline.  #### Best-practice Regurlarly check for the `SunsetHeader` and act as soon as the attribute appears by updating your integration to the new version within the presented time frame.  __example:__ ``` Warning: v2 is deprecated. Please migrate to v3 Sunset: Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT Deprecation: Wed, 11 Nov 2018 23:59:59 GMT Link: <https://api.otto.market/v3/orders>; rel=\"successor-version\" ```  ## Header Some common headers should be set by clients:  1. Set the <code class=\"inline\">X-Request-Timestamp</code> header according to the [ISO-8601](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) standard. You can use this regex pattern: <code class=\"inline\">^\\d{4}-(0\\d|1[0-2])-([0-2]\\d|3[01])T(2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d:[0-5]\\d(\\.\\d+)?(\\[+-](2[0-3]|[01]\\d):[0-5]\\d|Z)$</code> 2. Set <code class=\"inline\">Accept</code> to the desired response format e.g. <code class=\"inline\">application/json</code> 3. Set the <code class=\"inline\">Content-Type</code> header to define the used format in the request body, only applicable if you send a request body  ## HTTP Methods The interfaces describe which HTTP methods are allowed and how to use them. Our basic concern is that basically all HTTP Methods are allowed in the [standardized way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol). Note that these methods should behave as specified by their [standardized meaning (idempotency)](http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/idempotency/). The following is a description of a few special features, relevant facts or ways to use some of the HTTP methods. <details>   <summary>Click to expand for details</summary>  ### POST POST will update specific fields **and** returns the result like a GET would do (error response is independent).  ### PUT PUT will create or replace the whole entity independent of an existing entity.  ### PATCH PATCH will update specific fields **and** not return data like a GET would do (error response is independent). PATCH body is structured in the same way as PUT and POST (entity body). All fields added into your body will be updated, other fields will not be affected.  __example:__ ``` {   \"username\" : \"myusername\",   \"email\" : null } ``` </details>  ## HTTP Status Codes We are using [standardized HTTP status code](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html) with a body only if needed (it also just can be empty), but details about that you can find at the concrete interface implementation.  | Verb   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | HEAD   | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | | GET    | Used for retrieving resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | | POST   | Used for creating resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | | PATCH  | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has title and body attributes. A PATCH request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource. PATCH is a relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, so resource endpoints also accept POST requests. | | PUT    | Used for replacing resources or collections. For PUT requests with no body attribute, be sure to set the Content-Length header to zero.                                                                                                                                                                | | DELETE | Used for deleting resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  ## Error Message Style Error messages are returned as content type \"application/json;charset=utf-8\" in the following format: ``` {   \"errors\": [     {       \"path\": \"/orders/1000331\",       \"title\":  \"Invalid Attribute\",       \"code\": \"490\",       \"detail\": \"First name must contain at least three characters.\",       \"detail-structured\": {...},       \"jsonpath\": \"[@.orderid=='12345']/invoiceAddress/firstname\",       \"logref\": \"key to find in the log\"     }   ],   \"warnings\": [       {         \"path\": \"/orders/1000331\",         \"title\":  \"Warning Attribute\",         \"code\": \"WRONG_SPELLING\",         \"detail\": \"Last name should start with big letter.\",         \"detail-structured\": {...},         \"jsonpath\": \"[@.orderid=='12345']/invoiceAddress/lastname\",         \"logref\": \"key to find in the log\"       }     ] } ```  | Field             | Mandatory | Description                                                                                          | |-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | path              | yes       | called REST path                                                                                     | | title             | yes       | short description of the error                                                                       | | code              | no        | internal error code (number or enum) of your application / domain (do not use the HTTP status codes) | | detail            | no        | long description of the error, perhaps technical details                                             | | detail-structured | no        | technical details in JSON structure                                                                  | | jsonpath          | no        | JSON field in request which caused the error                                                         | | logref            | no        | reference key to find more stuff in the log (as example traceId)                                     |  ## Pagination Interfaces may return a list with resources (orders, shipments...) and a way to navigate these lists. Please pay attention to the response pattern to identify how to handle lists. There are two common ways list handling is implemented. One way to retrieve the next entry of a list is by using links for navigation the entries. The other is by providing list pages to iterate through lists.  For pagination, the basic query parameter \"limit\" (e.g. <code class=\"inline\">?limit=10</code>) can be used to define the maximum amount of resulting entities returned per call. The interface itself can reduce the limit lower than your client limit.  An example entity using links (not pages) to navigate would be: ``` {   resources: [     {       ...data of the entity if all or some information will be provided directly...,       links: [         {           href: \"/v1/orders/1234\",  <--- Link to single partner order           rel: \"self\"         }       ]     }   ],   links: [     {       href: \"/v1/orders?idGt=1234\", <--- Link to next list of ressources. If not present, no more records exist, currently       rel: \"next\"     }   ] } ```  ## Bulk requests Attention: When sending bulk requests to any /products API endpoint, it will be processed asynchronously at the backend.  ### Synchronous Answer Synchronously will be delivered an endpoint to check the asynchronous processing state. ``` HTTP STATUS 202 (Accepted) {     \"task\": {         \"href\": \"/interface/foo/123\",         \"id\": \"123\"     } } ```  ### Check the State of an Endpoint The client can follow the <code class=\"inline\">href</code> to check the state of processing.  #### Best-practice: As long as the `state = pending` the attribute `pingAfter` dictates when to send a new request.  An example entity would be: ``` {   \"state\": \"pending\",   \"message\": \"is running boy\",   \"progress\": \"35\",   \"total\": \"100\",   \"pingAfter\": \"2019-05-01T13:25:12+0200\",   \"links\": [     {       \"rel\": \"self\",       \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123\"     },     {       \"rel\": \"failed\",       \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/failed\"     },     {       \"rel\": \"succeeded\",       \"href\": \"/foo/bar/123/succeeded\"     }   ] } ```  ### Fetching files like PDF and CSV  Clients don't have to know the filetype that will be returned from a resource. Resources serving files will have the appropriate file extension in the URL as shown in the example below.  **Request Headers** ``` GET /SomeInvoice.pdf HTTP/1.1 Accept: *_/_* ```  Clients can find out the mime-type from the Content-Type header that will be sent in the response (e.g. application/pdf for PDF files and application/csv for CSV files).  **Response Headers**    ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 514493 Content-Type: application/pdf ```  ## Common fields Common fields like time, currency, country codes etc need to follow the standard ISO guidelines unless mentioned otherwise. The fields must report the format they are following on the docs.  ### Some standard formats: - Time: Accept in any time zone in ISO-8601 format and always reply in UTC.    Example: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `hh:mm:ss.sss`: `2020-03-12` and `22:33:34.400` - Currency: ISO-4217.    Example: `EUR` for Euros, `GBP` for British Pound Sterling. - Country code: ISO-3166-1 alpha-3    Example: `DEU` for Germany, `NOR` for Norway.   # Best Practices  *In the following you can find some best practises for working with our OTTO Market API which will help you to build up a better connection to our marketplace!*  1. Stay within the rate limits 2. Send data in Batch and fetch data as a list 3. Take action when getting back http 4** errors 4. Consider the two-step validation process for creating products 5. Consider the \"Unchanged\" status during product update or creation 6. Make sure product intentifier stay the same 7. Maintain the most relevant attributes for your products 8. Keep information provided by OTTO up to date 9. Consider the content requirements for product data 10. Utilize the MOIN as an identifier for further processes 11. Use Announced Orders for stock reservation  12. Consider the delivery type in the shipments  ## Stay within the rate limits  Each endpoint of the API has its own rate limits. These limits were set with the aim of ensuring optimal utilization of the server's available resources, maintaining the best quality for all API users, and facilitating the fastest possible processing of requests. Additionally, rate limiting errors can prevent important data from being entered into the system, leading to data discrepancies. Please take into account the rate limits when making your requests and adjust them accordingly if you receive HTTP 429 errors. You can find a complete list of the current rate limits [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Rate-Limiting).   ## Send data in Batch and fetch data as a list  To manage the load, it is advisable if the relevant endpoint makes it possible to send the data in bulk. Each endpoint has a different limit which must be considered. Please make the best possible use of the limit to reduce the number of requests. Some endpoints will perform your request asynchronously when sending data in bulk - for more information about bulk requests have a look [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Bulk-requests). If you want to retrieve data from the OTTO Market API, you should favor a list retrieval. Various parameters are available for retrieving the list in order to filter the list and achieve the desired result. Please make sure that you fetch all pages - for more information about the pagination have a look [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Pagination). In some cases, you can also perform a direct retrieval for individual SKUs. However, you should only do this selectively and always use the list retrieval for regular retrievals.   ## Take action when getting back http 4** errors  For each request you are sending to the OTTO Market API, you will receive a http code. Please make sure that for each client error (http codes 4**) you have a monitoring on your end and take action to reduce the amount of http 4** errors.  Each client error is caused by incorrect data in the request or payload and needs to be fixed before a retry will be forced. The best way is to show the error codes on your end and only send the data again, after the data were fixed.   ## Consider the two-step validation process for creating products   Product uploads go through a two-step validation process. Errors from the first validation stage can be viewed through the import error report ([GET /products/update-tasks](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__progressByProcessId)) and indicate a general product upload issue based on the body request schema. Errors from the second validation stage (otto.de) are embedded in the marketplace status ([GET /products/marketplace-status](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatusList)), and resolving these errors directly generates an offer on otto.de.  Please also note that the API is asynchronous and you need to get the results via the /products/update-tasks endpoint. This means that the 202: Accepted response you receive after sending a request indicates that we have received your request, but it does not guarantee that we have processed it.  ## Consider the \"Unchanged\" status during product update or creation  When managing product data, also consider retrieving and taking into account the results for \"unchanged\". Data sets that are found in the unchanged status of the import will be discarded by us. The reason is that exactly the same records have been sent without changes. However, this does not mean that the data sets were processed successfully as data sets that previously had errors and were sent again without any changes will also end up in the \"unchanged\" status. Find more information about the topic [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__unchangedByProcessId).  ## Make sure product identifier stay the same  The combination of **productReference** and **SKU** for one specific EAN cannot be changed once it has been successfully created in OTTO systems. However, if either of the two identifiers needs to be modified, it is necessary to first deactivate either the affected SKU or all SKUs associated with a productReference via the Active-Status endpoint ([POST /products/active-status/](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__updateActiveStatus) active=false).  After deactivating the SKU, the correct product data must be resubmitted. In case you´ve only updated the productReference and the SKU(s) stay the same, it is important to reactivate the affected SKU(s) via the Active-Status endpoint ([POST /products/active-status/](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__updateActiveStatus) active=true). If the SKUs have changed, they will be treated as new SKUs and will start with active=true status.   ## Maintain the most relevant attributes for your products  The assignment of products to filters and specific shopping paths on otto.de is based on the maintained attributes/features in the product data. For this purpose, the provided category list ([GET /products/categories](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getCategoryGroups)) offers indications of the relevance and importance of each attribute/feature. Highly important attributes/features are marked with **relevance=HIGH**. Additionally, the **featureRelevance** indicates the specific use of each attribute (e.g., LEGAL, FILTER, SEARCH, NAVIGATION,...) Please note: All attributes with featureRelevance = LEGAL are mandatory and needs to be maintained.  You can also find information about attributes relevant for the variant building on otto.de. The right attributes will be shown withing the **variationThemes**.  It is highly recommended to maintain as much attributes with relevance=HIGH to higher your visibility on otto.de.    ## Keep information provided by OTTO up to date  As changes to categories, attributes, and default values can occur, it is important to always have an up-to-date version of the category list ([GET /products/categories](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getCategoryGroups)). This ensures that only valid categories, attributes, and allowed values are transmitted. Similarly, the brand list ([GET /products/brands](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getBrands)) should be kept up to date. Regularly retrieving these lists, ideally on a daily basis, ensures their accuracy and minimizes the potential for errors.  ## Consider the content requirements for product data  During the product transfer, certain mandatory fields (such as SKU, EAN, category, brandid - see \"required\" in the request body schema of the [POST /products/](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__createOrUpdateProductVariations) endpoint and attributes marked within the category list with featureRelevance=LEGAL must be provided.  Additionally, specific formats for attributes/features must be adhered to. Furthermore, the defined formats for attributes/features and the technical requirements for media data (see below) must be considered. Compliance with the content requirements is essential for successful product upload, and conducting a pre-validation for these attributes/features helps minimize potential errors during the product transfer.  Technical requirements for media data:    • File formats:    ○ Images: JPG, PNG   ○ Documents: PDF  • Minimum dimensions for images: 500x1000 px (including color tiles and energy labels)  • File name: No special characters or umlauts  • Color space: RGB - Color spaces such as CMYK are not supported  • Maximum image side for image: 4500 px  ## Utilize the MOIN as an identifier for further processes  Always verify if the MOIN has been correctly retrieved and stored for each SKU. It should always match the MOIN you´ve get via the [marketplace status](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatusList), and this check should be performed regularly. Please use the list retrieval with the **lastModified** parameter to instantly detect any recent changes. This helps to prevent errors in the second validation stage regarding competition-related issues with products. Additionally, the MOIN can also be used as an identifier for inventory updates. When a SKU gets a MOIN in the OTTO systems, the SKU is correctly created and inventory could be sent. Inventory updates for SKUs which are not correctly created will end up in an error. This approach helps minimize the number of requests and optimizes the overall workload.  ## Use Announced Orders for stock reservation  Before an order receives the status **PROCESSABLE** and is therefore ready for processing, the order remains in the status **ANNOUNCED** for approximately 30 minutes after the customer order has been placed. During this time, the customer is able to cancel all or part of their order directly in their customer account. Customer orders with **paymentMethod=Prepayment** can remain in ANNOUNCED status for up to 10 working days. It is therefore advisable to retrieve the ANNOUNCED orders and reserve inventory accordingly in your system. This can prevent overselling and the associated higher cancellation rate.   ## Consider the delivery type in the shipments  Whether or not a **returnTrackingKey** must be provided when submitting a shipment request depends on the attributes maintained for the respective product. Please note that for all products that were created with **deliveryType=PARCEL**, you must also provide a returnTrackingKey when submitting the shipment request.    # Use-Cases  ## How to list your first product  *This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you list your first product on the OTTO Market. You´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*  To list a product you´ll have to do the following:  1. Authenticate 2. Read valid brands 3. Read valid categories 4. Post product 5. Check update-tasks 6. Check marketplace status 7. Update quantities  ### Authenticate At first you have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)  ### Read valid brands Next you have to read the valid brands and find your relevant brand. You can only sell brands where the attribute \"usable\" = true. If you cannot find your brand, you have to create a new one by following the brand creation process in the OTTO Partner Connect Portal.  https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getBrands  ### Read valid categories Following that you´ll need to read the valid categories to know which category to list your products in.  You are also be able to read from the list which attributes are mandatory (fe when listing in a specific category and which attribute is relevant for increasing the visibility of a product. Here you have to look after **relevance** and **featureRelevance** to get more information about customer relevance the usage of the attribute on otto.de. All attributes with the **featureRelevance=LEGAL** are mandatory for creating a product.  https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getCategoryGroups  ### Post product When you´ve gathered a valid brand and category, know which attributes you want to add and now it´s finally time to post your first product. By reading the documentation mentioned below you´ll learn which values (e.g. EAN, SKU, productDescription, ...) are required. Please note that the title on otto.de is created by OTTO using your information in the product data. The title is composed of individual fields such as \"category\", \"brandId\", \"productLine\"... The structure can be different for each category. An info about the structure you get also in the category list in the field \"title\". You´ll also find an example request for create or update product variants on this page. https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__createOrUpdateProductVariations  ### Check update-tasks If you´ve posted your product from the step before, you´ll reveice an http 202 with different links in the response. In the next step you have to check for errors by addressing the \"Update-Tasks\".  To get further information you have to proceed a get request with the \"self\" link. When the process state changed from \"pending\" to \"done\", you can fetch further information with the \"failed\", \"succeeded\" or \"unchanged\" link. In the response of the \"self\" link you also can see how much SKU can be found under which link. If there were errors you´ll have to solve these and post your updated product listing again. Don´t forget to check the update-tasks another time before carrying on. **Attention!** Posting the exact same data a second time is a bad idea since our server is configured to ignore duplicate listings. If a product data would have been ignored, you´ll find the information within the \"unchanged\" link. https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__progressByProcessId  ### Check marketplace status Last validation step for your product is to check the marketplace status of your SKU. Through Update-Tasks you´ll see if there are technical errors you´ll have to solve. In the marketplace status you´ll see if there are non-technical errors you´ll have to solve. As well the \"moin\" will be shown in the marketplace status at first. We recommend to fetch the marketplace status for each SKU as a list with the parameter \"fromDate\" in a regularer basis to see \"errors\" and get the current \"moin\".  https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatus  ### Update quantities Lastly you´ll have to set the quantities of your product so customers can finally see and buy your product. To reduce error messages, just sent over quantities for SKU wherefore you have gotten a \"moin\" via the marketplace status. https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Quantities-V2/operation/Quantities-V2__storeAvailableQuantitiesUsingPOST  **Congratulations!** You´ve successfully listed your first product on the OTTO Market. The next step is to regularly check for new orders. In the following case you can learn all about the order process and what you have to know about some specifics. [Click here to learn how to do that.](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases/Manage-an-order-from-start-to-finish)  ## Manage an order from start to finish  *This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you fulfilling your first order including subsequent activities on the OTTO Market. You´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*  To fulfill your first order and manage subsequent activities you´ll have to do the following:  1. Authenticate 2. Regularly check for new orders 3. Report order as shipped 4. Fetch purchase receipt 5. Regularly screen for return announcements 6. Process returns 7. Fetch refund receipt  ### Authenticate You´ll have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)  ### Regularly check for new orders Next you´ll have to regurlarly check for new orders to fulfill. We recommend checking several times a day. You´ll find the different fulfillment states orders can have, their descriptions and common use-cases listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4). We also recommend to fetch orders in the **state=ANNOUNCED** for the reservation of quantity on your end. After the order switched to the **state=PROCESSABLE** (usually after 35 Minutes except for the paymentMethod=prepayment) the customer information will be visible in the order. To carry on with fulfilling your first order the state has to be = PROCESSABLE.  https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4/operation/Orders-V4__findPartnerOrders  ### Report order as shipped Packaging the ordered items is next before you can hand them to your carrier and mark the order as shipped. We´ll call it a shipment from this point onward. Every shipment needs a **tracking key** and unless it´s a forwarder shipment you´ll also have to provide a **returnTrackingKey** upfront. If a returnTrackingKey is mandatory for a shipment is dependent on the deliveryType of the sku needed to fulfill in the shipment. You can manage the deliveryType for each sku within the productdata update process.  Please read the following endpoint for all technical information: https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1/operation/Shipments-V1__createdAndSentShipmentUsingPOST  If you want to fulfill a sku with more than one package, you´ll need to split the shipment and use [this endpoint](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1/operation/Shipments-V1__createdAndSentMultiparcelShipmentUsingPOST).  ### Fetch purchase receipt After the shipment was successfully created, a purchase receipts will be created on our end. These receipt will be shown to the customer in ther customer account. You can get the purchase receipt by using the receipts endpoint with the **receiptTypes=PURCHASE** as JSON. You also can fetch the receipt as PDF by using the **receiptNumber**. We recommend to use the parameter **receiptTypes** and the parameter **from** and **to**. You also can fetch receipts specifically for one order by using the parameter **salesOrderId**. For further information have a look in the description of the receipts api listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3) Please read the following endpoint for all technical information: https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3/operation/Receipts-V3__getReceiptsUsingGET_5  ### Regularly screen for return announcements Customers may want to return their order wholly or partially. Return labels will be created through their customer interface and the return status will change to announced. The status misdirected is also displayed to inform you that a customer has mistakenly returned the product to otto. It is recommended to regularly check for announced and misdirected returns using the following endpoint: https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2/operation/Returns-V2__getPositionItemsForUsingGETV2  ### Process returns Received returns have to be checked by your warehouse and either accepted or rejected depending on the condition of the return. Accepting a return will lead to a customer repayment. You can accept returns using this endpoint: https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2/operation/Returns-V2__receiveAcceptedReturnsV2UsingPOSTV2  If the condition of the return is unacceptable you´re able to reject the return. If you do so you have to submit a reason for the rejection: https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2/operation/Returns-V2__receiveRejectedReturnsV2UsingPOSTV2  ### Fetch refund receipt After the return was successfully created, a refund receipts will be created on our end. These receipt will be also shown to the customer in ther customer account. You can get the refund receipt by using the receipts endpoint with the **receiptTypes=REFUND** as JSON. Our recommendations in fetching the return receipts are same as they are in fetching the purchase receipt. Use different parameter to filter your request and get your relevant information. For further information have a look in the description of the receipts api listed at [this page](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3) Please read the following endpoint for all technical information: https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V3/operation/Receipts-V3__getReceiptsUsingGET_5  **Congratulation!** You´ve successfully gone through the whole order processing process on the OTTO Market. You should know which request are necessary for you and which specifics you have to note.  In the next step, we want to give you more information about after-sales processes. [Click here to learn how to do that.](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases/Manage-your-after-sales-actions)   ## Manage your after sales actions  *This sections goal is to guide you through our API docs and help you with your after sales actions. You will learn what kind of actions you can handle via the OTTO Market API and what you have to consider doing that.  You´ll find short introductions to the steps to be taken followed by a link to the technical documentation for that step.*  To manage your after sales activities you´ll have to do the following:  1. Authenticate 2. Get in touch with customer 3. Get customer messages 4. Give subsequent discounts (price-reductions)  ### Authenticate You´ll have to start by authenticating to the OTTO Market Server by posting your credentials to fetch an access token https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)  ### Get in touch with customer After the customer ordered a product from you, you will receive an encrypted e-mail address in the order. The encrypted e-mail address is part of the invoice address and should be used only in certain cases for the execution of the shipment or return. These cases can take place before and after the shipment is done. i.e. if you have some detailed questions about the delivery address, changes of the trackingNumber, reason why you rejected the return and to clarify the remainder of the goods and so on.  **Attention!** You must use as sender e-mail address the one that has been stored in the seller information for customer communication.   There could be also an e-mail address within the delivery address when a customer ordered a product which needs to be fulfilled via a forwarder agency. In this cases the correct e-mail address and phone number of the customer will be shown.  **Attention!** You may only use this contact information to pass it on to the shipping company so that they can contact the customer to clarify the delivery date.   ### Get customer messages Customer are able to contact you in specific cases to the shipment, order or for product relevant questions directly through the customer portal. You will receive the e-mail in the OTTO Partner Connect section \"Customer Communication\" and are able to send your answer directly in the portal. You´ll also have the option to get all customer messages directly to the e-mail adress you´ve stores in the seller information in the OTTO Partner Connect. You can reply directly to incoming mails.   ### Give subsequent discounts (price-reductions) If a customer is unsatisfied with the condition of the item he or she will usually return it. Depending on the product and the condition the customer might be interested in keeping the product if a discount is given. Customers usually contact you or OTTO to discuss such an option. You can either grant discounts within the OTTO Partner Connect or via the API within the \"price-reduction\" endpoint.  The following endpoint documentation describes how you´re able to provide such a \"price-reduction\": https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Price-Reductions-V1/operation/Price-Reductions-V1__applyPriceReduction   # Sandbox  ### General **Sandbox is the test environment,** used for testing an API connection. It provides all the functionalities of the live OTTO Market Interface. All actions and orders there are simulated for testing purposes.  The login session and the API key in the sandbox environment are completely separated from the production environment.  REST API: **https://sandbox.api.otto.market**  ## Getting started Follow these steps to start testing on our sandbox environment:  1.  Make yourself familiar with sandbox functionalities. 2.  Request a sandbox API user:     As a **partner (seller)** the fastest way is to open a new ticket in [OTTO Partner Connect](https://account.otto.market/s/ticketanlegen) through the Partner Helpdesk choosing the sub-category \"Technische Schnittstellen\".     As a **service provider** please register in our [OTTO Market Developer Program](https://developer.otto.market/).  3.  Authenticate to our sandbox environment. As Partner have a look at the [Developer's Guide](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)) and as service provider have a look at the specific information in [Developer Program](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Sandbox). 4.  Make yourself familiar with our [Best-Practice test cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Best-Practice-test-cases) and download the testcase file 5.  Use our Order Generator to create fictional orders. See [Order Generator](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Order-Generator)  below to know, which orders are created. 6.  Test the API functionality of your application.  ## Technical Advice Please note the following information: ### Authorization For the endpoint like all the other endpoints a valid authorization token has to be sent. If you need further information, please consult the [Developers Guide](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)).  ### Sandbox Reset To prevent data overload, our sandbox and its orders are reset monthly at first Sunday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.\\ Any dynamic data (shipments, returns) is deleted. Old shipments will not be available anymore.\\ Therefore, you have to create new orders every month.  ### Customer-Interactions in Sandbox Since there are no real costumers, all interfaces which work with customer data will either mock customer data or reduce the functionalities i.e. returns cannot be announced. Hence, the GET endpoint of returns is retrieving an empty string.   ### Product validation  Submitted product data is validated in two steps, which will be explainded further on:  **Attention:** Since the sandbox is missing a direct shop integration the second validation is simulated. For more details on how to test these functionalities, please have a look into our [Best-Practise test cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Best-Practice-test-cases), where you can find specific EANs for testing purposes.  **1. Technical validation**  The first technical validation (syntax and required attributes) takes place after you´ve sent product data using a POST request. Read more about uploading products [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__createOrUpdateProductVariations). If your http request was successful (http response state 202), you´ll be provided with four different links (pending, succeeded, failed, unchanged). Following the links you´ll be able to check which products have been successfully listed, failed, unchanged or are still being processed.  |Status|Explanation| |:-|:-| |Pending|The product listing is still being processed| |Succeeded|The shown products listing was successful| |Failed|Listing of all shown products has failed| |Unchanged|The request for the listed products is unchanged to the last request|  **2. Shop validation**  The second step is the shop validation. Results of the shop validation are retrievable using the **marketplace-status endpoint**. Please read the following [documentation](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V3/operation/Products-V3__getMarketPlaceStatusList) on how to use the marketplace status endpoint. Submitted product data always has one of the following four marketplace statuses:  | Status     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       | |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Pending    | Submitted product data is currently proceeded.                                                                                                                                    | | Online     | The SKU is displayed at otto.de. You can find the SKU using the shop link. <br />In some cases, additional information will be shown on how to improve the visibility on otto.de. | | Restricted | The SKU is not displayed at otto.de because of an error shown within the error’s container.                                                                                       | | Inactive   | The SKU was set inactive via the active-status endpoint and could be reactivated via the active-status endpoint.                                                                  |  **Attention:** Since the sandbox is missing a direct shop integration the second validation is simulated. For more details on how to test these functionalities, please have a look into our [Best-Practise test cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Best-Practice-test-cases), where you can find specific EANs for testing purposes.  ## Order Generator To test your API implementation you can generate test orders only on the sandbox environment by sending an empty POST request to the following generation endpoint:  [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders]()  This will run 8 predefined scenarios on our sandbox. After the POST request, you will receive 6 orders in \"PROCESSABLE\" status with different combinations of positions and items (e.g. standard and freight delivery). You will also receive 1 prepayment order in \"ANNOUNCED\" and 1 order in \"CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE\" status.  The generated orders will contain one or more position items with the following products:  | Product Title                       | EAN           | SKU                   | |-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------| | Smartphone »CallMe 1000«            | 1245780164732 | SmartCM1000-schwarz-1 | | Fancy Shirt »Flower«                | 4851278936452 | FancyFlower-m-pi      | | Rasenmaeher »Turbo V1«              | 9821393948573 | 0440-Rasen-T-V1       | | Spedition Wohnlandschaft 3.tlg.     | 8263748321943 | Sped-Wohn-3-98735     | | Spedition Kühlschrank »COOL EXTREM« | 7263000981290 | Sped-Kühl084-kombi    |  Scenarios:  | Scenarios        | Status                   | Comment                                                                                                              | |------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 | PROCESSABLE              | Scenario 4 inclusive discount                                                                                        | | 5                | ANNOUNCED                | Order with payment method PREPAYMENT awaiting customer's payment<br>Order includes weeePickup on position item level | | 6                | CANCELLED_BY_MARKETPLACE | Order with payment method PREPAYMENT which has been cancelled since the customer didn't pay                          |  Please use the generated orders to test the interaction with Orders, Shipments and Returns.  If you want to create a single scenario you can do that by sending an empty POST to:  [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario\\{scenarionumber\\}]()  e.g. [https://sandbox.api.otto.market/v4/orders/testorders/scenario1]()  ## Best-Practice test cases  We´ve come up with mulitple test cases to help you test the basic functionalities needed for each endpoint when offering your service to an OTTO Market Seller. The test cases should be tested within the sandbox environment. If you´re interested in feedback from our service provider management you can send screenshots of the test results [here](mailto:partnerintegration@otto.market?subject=[OTTO%20Market%20API]%20Service%20Provider%20test%20cases).  The Best-Practice testcases should help you as a developer to understand the behavior and the interdependencies between different APIs. With the test cases you can get hints for testing the interfaces and to reproduce the [Use-Cases](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Use-Cases) within the sandbox-environment.   We´re referring to the test orders created using the *test order generator* within the sandbox environment. Please read the section [Order Generator](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Sandbox/Order-Generator) on how to create test orders.  You can download a file where you can find the Best-Practice test cases [here](https://live.divae.developer.otto.market/_Resources/Persistent/1/d/1/7/1d17e046750554dbdb01d15aba7a53aa989d0e4e/Best-Practice-Testcases.xlsx).    # Developer Program This section describes how a service provider can integrate with OTTO Market API. The developer program aims at equipping the service providers with authentication and authorization for accessing the OTTO Market API `on behalf of the partner`.  ## Target Group The Developer Program is intended primarily for service providers who want to exchange data for OTTO Market Partners and offer their service to other sellers. OTTO Market Partners who would like to develop their own OTTO Market API connection use their own API user and can find more information [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/OTTO-Market-API-Developer's-Guide/Authorization-(OAuth2)).  ## Registration as Service Provider If you want to register as a service provider who needs to access Partner data, please follow the steps at [developer.otto.market](https://developer.otto.market/register). You'll receive email notifications for any approval / denial of registration requests.  After submitting your registration you will get access to the basic functionalities of our portal. To tailor your experience and unlock additional features, head over to the Permission Management Section. To start the journey you have to request your first permission for creating Sandbox Apps. With our confirmation, you will receive 30 days' test access to the sandbox environment for getting to know the inferfaces and estimate your effort without completing the registration process. If you decide to integrate, complete the registration by filling out the self-disclosure form. You will receive the form at the end of the 30-day test access period. We will grant you unlimited sandbox access afterwards.   At the point when you decide to go live and roll-out your service, you can request the permission for creating private production apps in the permission management. You need to start working with the production environment in private access first for test and learn with pilot integrations. Afterwards you can request public production access by request the right permission.   For more information about the registration and integration process, please have a look at [developer.otto.market](https://developer.otto.market).  ## Private and Public Access for Service Provider  Once you´ve done with testing, requested the permission **private production apps** and we cofirmed the permission, you can now create private apps in the Production environemnt.  (Read more about the difference between private and public apps [here](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Private-and-Public-Apps).)  ### Getting Public Access  If you want to get public access follow the steps below:  1. Login to OTTO Partner Connect portal and navigate to the Permission Management  2. Request the permission \"Public Production Apps\" 3. Select necessary scopes for your public access  4. Done! Your request will be reviewed by OTTO Market. You'll receive email notifications for approval / denial of your request.  *Please note: OTTO Market will perform a quality check for each selected scope. You only can go public after passed the quality check and finished an OTTO Market Training. The colleagues will give you more information during the integration process.*  ## Private and Public Apps  #### Private Apps  Private apps can be created by developer with the permission \"Private Production Apps\". If a OTTO Market partner wants to install a private app, an unique app invitation link (\"Einladungslink\") is required.  **Generate an app invitation link** You can generate an unique app invitation link for an app by following the steps below:  1. Login to the [OTTO Partner Connect](https://portal.otto.market/profile/Dienstleisterprofil) portal. 2. Navigate to the [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) and [Sandbox Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/sp-sandbox-apps) page for production and sandbox apps respectively. 3. Click on the three dots (…) right to the app name for which you want to create an invitation link. 4. In the dropdown menu select \"Einladungslink generieren\". 5. A popup window will be displayed. Copy the link from this window - it will not show up again. 6. Done! You can now share the app invitation link with a OTTO Market partner.  `Note:` You should be aware of the following: - After closing the popup window with the invitation link you won't be able to see this exact invitation link again. - You can create as much invitation links as you want to. - There is no possibility to show all invitation links created for a specific app. - Every app invitation link is only valid for 24 hours and can be used only once. (When it is used or expired the link will become invalid and you have to create a new one.) - If a partner clicks on the link but don't grant consent the link remains valid (until it is either expired or consent is granted).  #### Public Apps  Public apps can only be created developer with the permission \"Public Production Apps\". (For getting public access refer to [Getting Public Access](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Getting-Public-Access).) In order to install a public app, an universally valid installation link (\"Installationslink\") is required. After creating a public app this link is displayed in the app details page. You can share this link whereever you want. You can also add an optional parameter \"state\" to this installation link, which preserves the state of your application page and returns user back to that state after they install. If this optional parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with the optional state. But be aware that it is universally valid meaning you cannot control which partner will install your app.  ## Scopes Scopes corresponds to [OAuth scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/). They are used for providing fine-grained access control to the OTTO Market APIs.  ### Scopes for OTTO Market APIs The below table gives mapping of displayed scope names in UI to the scope names to be used for fetching token  | Display Name    | Scope Name (To be used in fetching token) | |-----------------|-------------------------------------------| | Installation    | installation                              | | PartnerId       | partnerId                                 | | Developer       | developer                                 | | Products        | products                                  | | Orders          | orders                                    | | Receipts        | receipts                                  | | Returns         | returns                                   | | Price Reduction | price-reduction                           | | Shipments       | shipments                                 | | Quantities      | quantities                                |  ### Content declaration of available scopes  #### Installation The installation interface allows a service provider to get the installation details of a Partner  #### PartnerId The partnerId interface allows a service provider, access to the partner's partner id.  #### Developer The developer interface allows a service provider to fetch an installation token  #### Products  The product interfaces allow partners to manage their product data in the OTTO Market, which means to send products for publishing on OTTO.de, to view the sent data, and to manage the visibility of the products on otto.de.  Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Products-V2).  #### Quantities  Once the products have been successfully transmitted using the products scope, only the quantities are missing to make the products available to the end customer on otto.de. For this purpose the Quantity Interface allows partners and service providers to update the available quantity for a specific SKU.  Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Quantities-V2).  #### Orders  This interface allows partners and service providers to view orders and associated position items. It also allows to send cancellations on order and position item level.  Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Orders-V4).  #### Shipments  This interface should be used to report that shipments have been handed over to the carrier for final delivery to the customer. You can also get access to Return-Shipments for retrieving track and trace data for returns from the customer to the partner warehouse.  Shipments - Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Shipments-V1). Return-Shipments - Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/ReturnShipments-V1).  #### Returns  This scope enables the user to manage returns. This includes retrieving a list of announced returns, accepting and declining returns.  Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Returns-V2).  #### Receipts  OTTO Market provides receipts to the customers to document financial processes. The scopes enables users to download these documents as a PDF or a JSON.  Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Receipts-V2).  #### Price Reduction  This endpoint enables sellers to apply price reductions to shipped products if the customer is unsatisfied and asks for a partial refund instead of returning the product completely.  Read more about the technical possibilities [here](https://api.otto.market/docs#tag/Price-Reductions-V1).  ## Sandbox vs Production Sandbox apps are used to test your API in sandbox environment, when you are approved for the permission \"Sandbox Apps\" by the OTTO Market team. These apps have unrestricted scopes access, so you can create sandbox apps for any scope even if you don´t need them in the production environment. For creating and testing with sandbox apps, please see [Access to Sandbox](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Sandbox).  As the name states, production apps are for production environment. This can be created after you have an approval from OTTO Market team for the permission \"Private Production Apps\". Once you have the approval, you can request for \"Public Production Apps\", to create public apps. An OTTO Market Partner has to provide consent, in order for you to access their production data. The detailed flow is described in the [Access to Production](https://api.otto.market/docs#section/Developer-Program/Access-to-Production) section below.   ## Access to Sandbox Once your permission request for \"Sandbox Apps\" is approved, you can start using [Sandbox Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/sp-sandbox-apps).  ### Creating sandbox test users In [Usermanagement UI](https://portal.otto.market/settings/Nutzerverwaltung) Service Providers can create their own test users for sandbox. This test user can be used for authenticating against sandbox apps  Valid email is required for sandbox users. Upon creation of user, a password setting mail will be sent to the given sandbox user emailId  **Please note:** Sandbox users are considered as part of the service provider count itself. You can create a max of 10 users (service providers + sandbox) by default.  Please also have a look in the [Download section](https://developer.otto.market/en/ressources/downloads.html) of developer.otto.market. There you can find a Step-by-Step Sandbox guide for testing the integration ([here](https://live.divae.developer.otto.market/_Resources/Persistent/0/6/5/d/065d35bbd75440623d592c45080cdcaf6637fde4/Sandbox%20guide%20for%20testing%20the%20integration%20of%20a%20retailer.pdf)).  ### Creating sandbox apps In create apps UI, you need to provide the following details, - unique name - homepage URL - authorization callback URL - Refer below section for more info - [scopes](docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) - All scopes will be listed in sandbox. - app type - Refer [Private and Public Apps](docs#section/Developer-Program/Private-and-Public-Apps) for more info  #### Post Installation Redirect URL Test Partner will be redirected to your post installation redirect URL after successfully installing your app.  #### Authorization callback URL 1. Post successful redirection, you will initiate authorization code flow. Test Partner logs in with their credential. On verifying identity, partner will be redirected to your app's authorization callback URL with auth code. 2. If you intend to incorporate query parameters in your REDIRECT_URI, ensure to suffix the url with an asterisk (*)  #### App ID A unique app ID which will be used for identifying a service provider app. When a partner installs this app, this app ID will be used for fetching the installation details.  #### Installation Link This unique, publicly accessible link will be used by OTTO Market partners for installation. An optional parameter \"state\" can be added to the link to preserve the state of application page. If the parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with this parameter. You can simply use this link as a hyperlink into your website.  #### Client ID & Client Secret Credentials to be used for authenticating & authorising your app with OTTO authorisation server for fetching installation details of partner  ## Access to Production Once you are satisfied with everything you have tested in the sandbox, you can request the permission \"Public Production Apps\" in the permission management in the OTTO Partner Connect Portal.  When approved, you can start creating production apps using [OTTO Market Apps](https://portal.otto.market/app-management/service-provider/apps) in OTTO Partner Connect.  ### Creating apps In create apps UI, you need to provide the following details, - unique name - homepage URL - authorization callback URL - Refer below section for more info - [scopes](docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) - Only scopes approved for you will be shown - app type (only if the service provider has public access)  #### Post Installation Redirect URL Partner will be redirected to your post installation redirect URL after successfully installing your app.  #### Authorization callback URL 1. Post successful redirection, you will initiate authorization code flow. Partner logs in with their credential. On verifying identity, partner will be redirected to your app's authorization callback URL with auth code. 2. If you intend to incorporate query parameters in your REDIRECT_URI, ensure to suffix the url with an asterisk (*)  #### App ID A unique app ID which will be used for identifying a service provider app. When a partner installs this app, this app ID will be used for fetching the installation details.  #### Installation Link This unique, publicly accessible link will be used by OTTO Market partners for installation. An optional parameter \"state\" can be added to the link to preserve the state of application page. If the parameter exists, the user will be redirected to app's callback URL along with this parameter. You can simply use this link as a hyperlink into your website.  #### Client ID & Client Secret Credentials to be used for authenticating & authorising your app with OTTO authorisation server for fetching installation details of partner    ## Installation of app by an OTTO Partner (Sandbox | Production) <img src=\"/docs/app_installation_flow.jpg\" alt=\"App Installation\"/>  1. The partner navigates to your application's installation link and installs your application. If desired, a \"state\" parameter can be added to the installation link for tracking the installer of your application.  2. After successful installation, the partner is redirected to your application's authorization callback URL. If a \"state\" query parameter was included in the installation link, it will be added to the callback URL, redirecting the user upon successful installation.  3. Within your callback logic, authenticate the partner user and obtain an access token by implementing the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow:     3.1. Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint with scopes `installation` and `partnerId`. The server should respond with a HTTP 302 response that redirects the user-agent to the authorization URL, which includes parameters like client_id, redirect_uri, response_type, and scope.     - Sandbox: https://sandbox.api.otto.market/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope=installation%20partnerId     - Production: https://api.otto.market/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope=installation%20partnerId     Please note that 'REDIRECT_URI' is optional. It serves as the URI where your app can send and receive authentication responses.    The 'REDIRECT_URI' must precisely match the protocol, host, and URL path (excluding query parameters) specified in your app's authorization callback URL OR should be a superset of the authorization callback URL specified on your app.     3.2 User logs in and verify their identity     3.3. After the user grants authorization, your application will receive an authorization code at the redirect URI provided. The server will respond with a HTTP 302 that directs the user-agent to the provided redirect URI.     3.4. Exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to the token endpoint, including the authorization code, redirect URI, client ID and client secret in the body. Ensure the `Content-Type` header is set as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.  - Sandbox: https://sandbox.api.otto.market/oauth2/token - Production: https://api.otto.market/oauth2/token  For Example:  ``` POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1 Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  grant_type=authorization_code&client_id={yourClientId}&client_secret={yourClientSecret}&code={yourAuthorizationCode}&redirect_uri={https://yourApp/callback}  ```  For more information on implementing the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow, please refer to the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) section of the OAuth2 standard documentation. You can retrieve the necessary endpoints from the OpenID Connect well-known configuration:  - Sandbox Well-Known Endpoint: [Sandbox Well-Known Endpoint](https://sandbox.api.otto.market/sec-api/auth/realms/deepsea-sandbox/.well-known/openid-configuration) - Production Well-Known Endpoint: [Production Well-Known Endpoint](https://api.otto.market/sec-api/auth/realms/otto-partner/.well-known/openid-configuration)  4. Upon successful user authentication, retrieve the Installation ID by sending a GET request to the endpoint `/v1/apps/{appId}/installation`. The domain will be sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market based on whether you're in a sandbox or production environment. Replace `{appId}` with your specific service provider application's unique ID. Use the access token obtained in the previous step.     ```    GET /v1/apps/{appId}/installation HTTP/1.1    Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market    Authorization: Bearer {access_token}    ```     The response will be:     ```    {      \"installationId\": \"string\"    }    ```  5. Implement the Client Credentials Flow to fetch an access token with the `developer` scope:     ```    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1    Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded     grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}&scope=developer    ```     Replace `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{CLIENT_SECRET}` with your actual client ID and client secret.  6. With the obtained token, retrieve an installation access token by making a POST request to `/v1/apps/{appId}/installations/{installationId}/accessToken`. The request body should be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and include the `scope` parameter with the values such as `orders`, `shipments`, `receipts`. Please see [Developer Program](/docs#section/Developer-Program/Scopes) for list of available scopes. Multiple scope values should be space separated.     ```    POST /v1/apps/{appId}/installations/{installationId}/accessToken HTTP/1.1    Host: sandbox.api.otto.market or api.otto.market    Authorization: Bearer {access_token}    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded     scope={SCOPE_VALUES}    ```     The response will be:     ```    {      \"access_token\": \"token\",      \"expires_in\": 1800    }    ```  Please note that in step 6, the Host header should be either `sandbox.api.otto.market` or `api.otto.market`. Additionally, the Authorization header should include the value `Bearer {access_token}` obtained in step 5.  You can now use this installation access token to authenticate your requests when accessing OTTO Market APIs. Include the access token in the Authorization header with the value Bearer {access_token} for subsequent API calls. Please note that once the access token expires, repeat steps 5 and 6 to obtain a new access token and installation access token respectively. Use the updated tokens for continued access to OTTO Market APIs.
